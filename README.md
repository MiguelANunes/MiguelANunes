## Hi, I'm migs

I'm a logician and computer scientist who dabbles in philosophy, mainly philosophy of science and philosophy of computer science.

Currently I'm pursuing a Master's Degree in Philosophy at the Institute of Philosophy and Human Sciences of Unicamp, though I spend most of my time at the Center of Logic, Epistemology and History of Science.

I do a lot of stuff with LaTeX, mostly bodges, some stuff with proof assistants, mostly Coq, and little stuff with code, mostly Python and Shell Scripts.
