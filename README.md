## Hi, I'm migs

I'm a logician (by heart) and computer scientist (by training) who dabbles in philosophy, mainly philosophy of science and philosophy of computer science.

Currently I'm pursuing a Master's Degree in Philosophy at the Institute of Philosophy and Human Sciences of Unicamp, though I spend most of my time at the Center of Logic, Epistemology and History of Science (CLE), and also I'm working on a library of modal logic in Coq (see publications bellow).

I'm a member of the Research Group on Foundations of Computation (Grupo de Pesquisa em Fundamentos da Computa√ß√£o - Fun√ß√£o) from the State University of Santa Catarina (Udesc), we are [here in GitHub](https://github.com/funcao) and also on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/funcao.udesc/).

I do a lot of stuff with LaTeX, mostly bodges, some stuff with proof assistants, mostly Coq, and little stuff with code, mostly Python and Shell Scripts.
